A Muttator Reference Sheet / Cheat Sheet

Muttator v0.6 for Thunderbird v3.0 and 3.1.* (muttator-20100629.xpi)

The main thing to know about using Muttator is that there are two primary modes, EX mode and MESSAGE mode, and keyboard mappings can work very differently in the two modes. It's not obvious which mode you're in; you have to look at the bottom left of your Thunderbird window where the status line with either be blank (EX mode) or will say "-- MESSAGE --". There is also an odd "-- CARET --" mode that you'll probably want to <ESC> out of as soon as possible.

When composing a new message, the two primary modes are "-- COMPOSE --" and "-- INSERT --". While typing in INSERT mode, you can press <ESC> at any time to return to COMPOSE mode.
